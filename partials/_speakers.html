                  <h3>Dimitar Delev</h3>
                  <p>A somewhat experienced software developer specialized in JavaScript with a passion for functional programming and avid fan of the latest EcmaScript standards and React and a love for learning new (and old) exciting things.</p>
                  <p>I aim to help and develop the community through lectures and tech talks. To achieve this, I have participated in local community events such as Beer&Code, and held courses in Brainster and within the confines of my current employer Melon Tech.</p>
                  <p>In addition to this I am a part of the organization and conduction of a local meet up group called BeerJS Skopje, which is tied to the global organization that promotes local meetups of JavaScript developers.</p>
                  <p>I also like to spend time on tabletop roleplaying games, board games, the guitar, biking, painting, drawing as well as cooking. I am also a painter and collector of miniatures in my spare time.</p>
